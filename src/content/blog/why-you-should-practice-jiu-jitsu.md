Sure, learning to pin someone, isolate their limbs and snap them one by one is super cool. It’s also really cool knowing you have the power to strangle another man unconscious with your bare hands. 

More importantly however, jiu jitsu teaches you how to *escape* bad positions. Hélio Gracie, one of the founders of jiu jitsu has been quoted as saying jiu jitsu is about *survival*. 

Sometimes all we can do is survive. Sometimes surviving five minute can determine whether we live or die. Whether someone walks by and is able to help us. 

So far, we’ve discussed why you should practice jiu jitsu from both an offensive and a defensive perspective. Now however, is the *most* important reason why you practice jiu jitsu. Jiu jitsu *changes you*. 

Jiu jitsu is a practice that allows you to face your fears. Over and over, day after day. Eventually you learn to be comfortable when experiencing fear. You learn to breathe. To focus on your next move. To relax.

See you on the mats!

Oss!
