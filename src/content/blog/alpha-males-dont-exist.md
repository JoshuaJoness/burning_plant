# Alpha males don’t exist (and other bullshit the culture wants you to believe)

Alpha males don’t exist. A quick search of Reddit will reveal people expressing their disdain for the concept of alpha males, often labelling the concept “cringy.”

But I’m sure you’ve felt it. When that confident man walks into the room; you feel his presence. There is an aura to him. 

The problem is that the popular concept of an alpha male has largely become a parody. With internet celebrities flashing expensive lifestyles, young boys think this is what the alpha male is. It’s not. Finances can be part of being an alpha male, but true alphas are not defined by material possessions. True alphas know that material things come and go and therefore, we cannot let ourselves be defined by material things. We must be defined by something deeper. Something intangible. A certain “je ne sais quoi.”

Alpha males are generative. In “King, Warrior, Magician, Lover” the author Robert Moore explains that the true masculine is generative. The image I like to think about is a strong father raising his daughter. He is nurturing, he is caring, he is protective, he is strong - this is the alpha male. 

So in order to be an alpha male, we must have these qualities of strength. This leads us to think that in order to step into our Alpha or our “King Energy” as Moore puts it, we must get strong. Therefore, getting stronger and doing hard shit is a must for men who want to become strong, valiant, brave leaders. Men who want to become good fathers must set good examples for their children. 

Is being fat, out of shape, unable to do a pull up setting a good example for your children? No! Fuck no!

Men must lift, men must be strong, men must be smart. But don’t fall into the meat head trap of only being a bit buffoon. You’ve got to train your mind just as hard as you train your body. You’ve got to acquire skills. You need to have great communication skills. You must project confidence. This is how you get others to trust you. This is how you find new work and business opportunities. This is how you improve your financial situation. So yes, money is important for alpha males, but not just for flaunting and driving Bugattis - money is important because it is a marker, it is how we keep score of one’s value in the market. It also how we keep score of one’s discipline. If you’re living pay check to pay check and you make good money, you probably have some shitty habits. Maybe you’re eating out all the time. Maybe you’ve got alcohol, drug, or sex addiction. Maybe you’re a spendthrift and have no self-control to delay gratification. Again, the point here is that you gotta get your money right. Simply for the fact of what that represents. 

Alpha males are brave. When someone breaks into your house at 3 in the morning. Are you going to cower behind your wife, arguing with her about who will go see what’s happening? No! Women want a protector, they want a man with whom they can feel safe. This is why learning combat skills and testing your combat skills is important. Jiu jitsu is a great vehicle for this. Jiu jitsu incorporates live sparring, besides MMA, this is probably the closest you will get to a real life altercation. Competing is another level of this. 

Alpha males are abundant. Think about it. Back in the cave man days, would the leader of the tribe be looking to others for approval and reassurance? No! Fuck no! That motherfuxker would be confident and self-assured, perhaps even rubbing some people the wrong way - but guess what? He doesn’t give a fuck. Balance your not giving a fuck with a loving energy. How do we do this? By recognizing that the world is inherently abundant. By practicing faith. Realize there are tons of jobs out there. If someone else can get a job, why can’t you? Recognize that there are people not as smart as you, not as disciplined as you starting businesses everyday. Why not you? It’s simply a lack of belief in one’s self. We have self-limiting beliefs. We can begin to change this by exercising faith, cultivating a spiritual practice, having an attitude of gratitude, and looking up at the stars and realizing that there is something magical, vast, and inherently abundant about this universe. We are this universe and we are taken care of. Step into that energy. 

Alpha males are loving. In “Kings Warrior, Magisin, lover” Moore describes how the King’s role is to order and balance all of the other energies within one’s self. If we have too much warrior energy for example, this can be bad for us. A man may become too detached, or too aggressive, unable to be tender and loving. A real alpha knows how to love his woman. Not fuck her while fantasizing in his head, no, he really makes love to her. I recommend reading about Robert Moore’s Lover archetype and reading up on Tantric Sex. Dianna’s book is great.

**summary**
- Society doesn’t want you to be strong, independent, and free
- They want you weak, obedient and taking pills
- Alpha males are not the caricature you see online
- Yes, alpha males are strong and brave. But they are also nurturing, intelligent, wise, and loving. 

**bonus**
- Alpha males do not fear failure
- They are constantly seeking growth
- They challenge themselves constantly
- And they are relaxed when others are tensed
- Cool, calm, and collected
- A real G 
- Don Corleone
