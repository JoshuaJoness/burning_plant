Kimuras and Bench is a blog for men, by men. In mainstream society, traditional masculine virtues are being demonized. Virtues such as strength, 
aggresion, courage, and stoicism are no longer valued. 

As a result, young men do not know how to handle their natural urges to kill and f*ck. Instead of 
pursuing healthy outlets such as BJJ (Jiu Jitsu), weight lifting, running, and engaging in healthy relationships, 
men are turning to video games, and other online distractions to alleviate their primal urges. 

This may work temporarily, but it is 
masking the problem and not getting to the root cause of the discontent and lack of
purpose that many men feel in modern times.

## Mission

We hope to inspire you to step
into the greatest version of yourself. We want to inspire you to build, create, f*ck, fight,
and kill anything that stands between you and your goals. 

At the same time, we aim to 
impart you with the stoic wisdom that zen masters have known about for eons, chiefly, that
although we must pursue our goals, ultimately we cannot be attached to them.
